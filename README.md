This program will rip certain radio streams to individual .mp3 files.  It creates a new file each time the program gets a new title/artist from the stream.

It was intended for radio personell to monitor their straming station and record for later review.
Since the filenames do not change during commercial breaks, the files including these breaks are the largest.  The stations could then look for these files to monitor which commercials aired or adjust any audio delays in the switching to and from the breaks.

TODO:
- For talk stations (without any title/artist), create a way to record segments by time rather tahn the song change.  Perhaps a "Talk" button.
- A way to monitor the stream being recorded rather than starting two streams (one for recording and the other for monitoring).
